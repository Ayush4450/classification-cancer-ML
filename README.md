This project aims to find out the best Machine Learning Model for the 
classification of Cancer into Benign and Malignant. The dataset is taken from 
Kaggle website named as Cancer_data. Cancer may occur in two different 
categories like malignant and benign tumors and it is the difficult task for the 
physicians to classify the type of tumor. So, the health care domain requires some 
reliable methodologies to predict the tumor cell and its type. The automation in 
the tumor identification can be achieved by employing machine learning 
algorithm for the detection purpose. The earlier detection of the disease will help 
the doctors to cure the disease so it may reduce the cause of death and can save 
many patients life. 
 
Objective â€“  
1. Identify cancer at its earliest stages to enhance treatment outcomes and 
improve survival rates.

2. Determine the most appropriate and effective treatment options based on 
the cancer's type, stage, and specific molecular characteristics.

3. Facilitate cancer research by categorizing tumors into distinct subtypes, 
enabling the development of targeted therapies and personalized medicine 
approaches.

5. Continuously assess the effectiveness of cancer classification systems and 
adapt them to evolving scientific knowledge and clinical practice.

Results -
We compare the results and performance of different machine learning models 
with neural networks. We analyze the accuracy and other relevant metrics to 
determine the most effective model for predicting cancer. This comparison helps 
us choose the model that provides the highest predictive accuracy and 
reliability. 
We can clearly see that the accuracy of Linear Discriminant Analysis Model is 
the highest among the others. Hence, it is considered as the best performing 
model. We can further analyze the LDA model by generating the classification 
report and making the confusion matrix. It has been found out that out of 114 
samples, there is only one sample which has been wrongly classified by the 
LDA Model but rest 113 samples are correctly classified.
